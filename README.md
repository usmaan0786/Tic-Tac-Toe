# Tic-Tac-Toe
I have created an engaging Tic Tac Toe game using C# and the .NET framework. This classic game offers a fun and interactive experience for players of all ages.

The Tic Tac Toe game features a user-friendly interface that allows players to easily navigate and enjoy the gameplay. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, where players take turns placing their respective symbols, usually X and O, in an attempt to form a winning pattern.

To enhance the gaming experience, I have implemented logic that automatically detects and declares a winner when a player successfully aligns three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the game board. In case of a tie where neither player achieves a winning combination, the game is declared a draw.
